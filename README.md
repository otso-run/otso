## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds and from contributors of every backgroundâ€”from code and docs to design, translations, and community building. Read our [Contributing guide](https://otso.run/overview/contributing/) to get started.

## Open Source Philosophy

Otso is built in the open to empower individuals and communities. We believe software should be transparent, forkable, and shaped by those who use it. By sharing our work and collaborating publicly, we strive to create tools that respect privacy, encourage portability, and grow through collective stewardship.
