I want to make my first iOS app using AI coding in Xcode 26 that‚Äôs a micropub client

###### ChatGPT said:

Love it. A Micropub client is a perfect first iOS app‚Äîclean scope, real API, and lots of room to grow.

Quick first step so we keep momentum: for the MVP, do you want to aim for just **‚Äúpost a plain text note to your Micropub endpoint after IndieAuth login‚Äù**? (One screen + login, then a Post button.)

###### ChatGPT said:

This is already a stellar feature map‚Äîclear, detailed, and opinionated in all the right places. To move it toward something you can actually ship, the next step is to collapse it into a **lightweight PRD**. That way you have:

- **Problem framing**: why Otso exists.
- **Goals**: what success looks like for v1.0.
- **Non-goals**: what you explicitly *won‚Äôt* do in v1.0.
- **Requirements**: distilled feature list tied to MVP scope.
- **Milestones**: v1.0 (MVP), v1.1, v1.2, v1.3.

Once that‚Äôs nailed, we can spin out **wireframes** (compose, outbox, settings, share sheet) that match the minimalist/local-first ethos.

üëâ Do you want me to draft the PRD now, with your feature map boiled into those sections, or jump right into quick wireframes for the core v1.0 flows?

Just a concise outline phased into achievable chunks for learning to implement an iOS app with new liquidglass UI

###### ChatGPT said:

got it ‚Äî here‚Äôs a tight, learn-by-shipping roadmap to build **Otso** with a **LiquidGlass** UI. each phase has what you‚Äôll learn and what you‚Äôll ship. keep phases small; ship after each.

# Phase 0 ‚Äî Project skeleton (1 screen)

**Learn:** Xcode project setup, SwiftUI app life cycle, SwiftPM, app architecture.  
**Ship:**

- App target + **Modules**: `MicropubClient`, `OutboxQueue`, `ComposerKit`, `MediaPipeline` (empty stubs).
- SwiftUI root with 3 tabs: **Compose ¬∑ Outbox ¬∑ Library** (placeholders).
- Local storage choice set (Core Data or GRDB) wired with 1 table: `Draft`.  
	**Focus:** build ‚Üí run fast; logging; feature flags.

# Phase 1 ‚Äî LiquidGlass UI foundation

**Learn:** SwiftUI materials, blurs, translucency, depth.  
**Ship:**

- **LiquidGlass** style layer (one file):
	- Background: `Rectangle().background(.ultraThinMaterial).blur(radius: 8)` behind content.
	- Elevation tokens: `glassCard()`, `glassToolbar()` view modifiers (adds material + stroke overlay + subtle shadow).
	- Depth: subtle parallax on scroll, 1‚Äì2pt inner highlight, dynamic corner radius.
- Color system: light/dark adaptive, high-contrast pass.  
	**Focus:** 60fps; avoid over-blur (off-main-thread images only).  
	**Stretch:** Reduce transparency under **Reduce Transparency** accessibility.

# Phase 2 ‚Äî IndieAuth (PKCE) + Account model

**Learn:** ASWebAuthenticationSession, PKCE, Keychain.  
**Ship:**

- **Login flow**: discover authorization endpoint from `me` ‚Üí start IndieAuth ‚Üí save token.
- `Account { id, meURL, token, endpoint, mediaEndpoint, syndicationTargets[] }` persisted.  
	**Focus:** error surfaces, cancellation, secure token in Keychain.  
	**Stretch:** multi-account switcher.

# Phase 3 ‚Äî Micropub capability discovery

**Learn:** HTTP, q= endpoints, JSON parsing.  
**Ship:**

- Call `q=config` to detect **media endpoint** + **syndication targets**; cache with ETag.
- Minimal `MicropubClient.create(properties:)` (x-www-form-urlencoded + JSON).  
	**Focus:** retries with backoff & idempotency keys.

# Phase 4 ‚Äî Compose (Note + Photo) MVP

**Learn:** SwiftUI forms, keyboard management, photo picker.  
**Ship:**

- Full-screen **Compose** with kind switcher (Note/Photo), text area with live count, tag chips.
- Photo pipeline (HEIC‚ÜíJPEG, resize, EXIF strip toggle).
- **Draft autosave** each keystroke.  
	**Focus:** zero-jank typing: debounce writes, background saves.  
	**Stretch:** alt-text nudges; Markdown/plain toggle.

# Phase 5 ‚Äî Outbox queue (local-first engine)

**Learn:** background tasks, reachability, state machines.  
**Ship:**

- `QueueItem { id, draftId, attempts, lastError, state }`.
- Send pipeline: create ‚Üí media upload ‚Üí final post; per-item retry/backoff; network awareness.
- **Outbox tab**: pending/sent/failed lists; tap to retry.  
	**Focus:** never block UI; optimistic ‚ÄúPosted‚Äù toast with rollback on fail.  
	**Stretch:** ETag-based reconcile if server returns updated properties.

# Phase 6 ‚Äî Share Extension

**Learn:** Extensions, host app communication, sandboxed media handling.  
**Ship:**

- **Share Sheet**: accepts text/URLs/photos ‚Üí opens lightweight composer ‚Üí queues to Outbox.  
	**Focus:** memory limits; small thumbnails; background transfer.  
	**Stretch:** quick kind inference (URL ‚Üí Bookmark, image ‚Üí Photo).

# Phase 7 ‚Äî App Intents & Shortcuts

**Learn:** AppIntents framework, parameters.  
**Ship:**

- Intents: **New Note**, **Post Photo**, **Append to Draft** (params: tags, visibility).  
	**Focus:** privacy-sensitive defaults; no UI blocking.

# Phase 8 ‚Äî Library & JF2 export

**Learn:** list performance, file export.  
**Ship:**

- **Library tab** of local posts/drafts, filters by kind/tag.
- **Export** to JSON/JF2 into Files/iCloud.  
	**Focus:** fast scrolling (diffable data, lightweight rows).

# Phase 9 ‚Äî Settings & privacy

**Learn:** Settings bundles, Keychain, file management.  
**Ship:**

- Accounts, defaults (kind/visibility/tags), media size/format/EXIF, data export/delete, crash logs opt-in.  
	**Focus:** clear, minimal; everything off by default.

# Phase 10 ‚Äî Polish the LiquidGlass design

**Learn:** haptics, animation curves, accessibility audits.  
**Ship:**

- Motion language: subtle scale/opacity on present/dismiss; spring for post success.
- Glass tokens doc: corner radii, stroke opacities, blur radii, shadow Z-levels.  
	**Focus:** Dynamic Type/VoiceOver labels; color-contrast AA+.

---

## Minimal data layer (you‚Äôll implement across phases)

- **Draft**: `id, accountId, kind, content, properties(json), mediaRefs[], createdAt, updatedAt, status`
- **MediaAsset**: `id, localURL, processedURL, width, height, alt, exifStripped(bool)`
- **QueueItem**: `id, draftId, attempts, lastError, state(pending/sent/failed)`
- **Account**: `id, meURL, token, endpoint, mediaEndpoint, syndicationTargets[]`

---

## Guardrails & perf checklist

- Cold start snappy; defer heavy work (capability fetch) until after first frame.
- Image work off main thread; cap decoded size by device class.
- Debounce disk writes; batch Core Data/GRDB transactions.
- Use BGTaskScheduler for queue flush; backoff with jitter.
- Material/blur used on solid backdrops; keep layers shallow.

---

## Nice-to-have learning add-ons (after v1.0)

- **Scheduling** via background tasks + local notifications.
- **Syndication UI** (choose targets per post kind).
- **Location** picker with coordinate fuzzing.
- **Markdown helpers** (inline toolbar).
- **Microsub** reader module (separate target).

---

if you want, I can turn this into a **tracked checklist** (markdown) or a **starter Xcode project structure** (folders + empty types) so you can start committing immediately.
