##### You said:

how should I organize the repositories, I need a website, core, create via npm, and then there will be tons of extensions for sources, targets, and plugins

###### ChatGPT said:

Here‚Äôs a battle-tested way to set this up for scale, speed, and lots of extensions ‚Äî without turning into dependency spaghetti.

# Big picture

- **One primary monorepo** for all ‚Äúfirst-party‚Äù stuff (core, CLI, web app/site, shared libs, official plugins).
- **Many small polyrepos** for ‚Äúcommunity/3rd-party‚Äù extensions, each with its own lifecycle but validated against the monorepo via CI.
- **A lightweight public registry** (JSON + docs page) that lists all known plugins and their compatibility ranges.

# GitHub org & npm scope

- GitHub org: **`otso-run`** (you‚Äôve got it).
- npm scope: **`@otso-run/*`** for first-party packages.
- Third-party plugins: **`@<author>/otso-<type>-<name>`** (or any scope) but must include a manifest.

---

# Repos layout

## 1) Monorepo: `otso`

**Tooling:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo (or Nx), Changesets for versions, Vitest, Biome/ESLint, Prettier.

```

### Package names (examples)

- `@otso-run/core`
- `@otso-run/cli`
- `@otso-run/server`
- `@otso-run/schema`
- `@otso-run/create-otso`
- `@otso-run/adapter-db-sqlite`
- `@otso-run/plugin-source-github`
- `@otso-run/plugin-target-micropub`
- `@otso-run/plugin-transform-exif`

> Keep **adapters** (DB, storage, cache) separate from **plugins** (sources, targets, transforms). It clarifies lifecycles.

## 2) Template repo for extensions: `plugin-template`

A minimal, copy-friendly repo with CI, tests, manifest, and publishing setup. Name it:

- `plugin-template` (root) and instruct authors to `Use this template`.
- Ships with `pnpm`, `vitest`, `tsup`, GitHub Actions, and a **compatibility check** job that pulls the latest `@otso-run/core` and runs conformance tests.

## 3) Community registry: `plugins`

A tiny repo that holds:

- `registry.json` (array of plugins with name, npm, repo, type, semver compatibility, tags).
- A PR flow for submissions.
- The docs site consumes this JSON to render a searchable directory.

## 4) Website: (either inside monorepo `/web` or separate repo `website`)

Given you‚Äôll cross-link docs and registry, **keep it in the monorepo** to simplify previews and shared components.

---

# Versions & releases

- **Changesets** drives releases.
	- Core + first-party plugin versions are independent but released from the monorepo.
	- Use **semver + peerDependencies** to enforce compatibility: e.g. `peerDependencies: { "@otso-run/core": "^1.3.0" }`.
- **Release channels:** `next` dist-tag for pre-releases; `latest` for stable.
- **CI matrix** runs quick build/test per package, and a **plugin E2E matrix** that installs a sample set of community plugins to ensure nothing regresses.

---

# Plugin model (discovery, manifest, lifecycle)

### File layout (plugin repo)

```
otso-plugin-<type>-<name>/
  src/index.ts
  otso.plugin.json
  package.json
  README.md
  tests/
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### `otso.plugin.json` (manifest)

```
{
  "name": "otso-plugin-source-github",
  "type": "source",               // "source" | "target" | "transform" | "utility"
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "entry": "./dist/index.js",
  "compat": { "@otso-run/core": "^1.3.0" },
  "capabilities": ["ingest","webhook","backfill"],
  "configSchema": "https://schemas.otso.run/plugin-config.json",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/author/otso-plugin-source-github",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Discovery

- The CLI/server loads plugins via:
	1. **Explicit config** (`otso.config.(ts|cjs|json)`): list of packages or paths.
	2. **Conventional scan** of `dependencies` matching:
		- `@otso-run/plugin-*`
		- `*otso-plugin-*`
- Validate with `@otso-run/schema` (Zod) and print clear diagnostics.

### Minimal plugin interface (TypeScript)

```
export interface OtsoPlugin {
  name: string;
  type: "source" | "target" | "transform" | "utility";
  setup(ctx: OtsoContext): Promise<void> | void;
}

export interface SourcePlugin extends OtsoPlugin {
  fetchSince?(cursor: Cursor | null, opts: FetchOpts): AsyncIterable<Item>;
  ingestWebhook?(req: IncomingRequest): Promise<IngestResult>;
}

export interface TargetPlugin extends OtsoPlugin {
  publish(item: Item, opts?: PublishOpts): Promise<PublishResult>;
}

export interface TransformPlugin extends OtsoPlugin {
  transform(item: Item, opts?: TransformOpts): Promise<Item | null>;
}
```

# The ‚Äúcreate via npm‚Äù experience

Package: `@otso-run/create-otso`  
Users run:

```
npm create @otso-run@latest
# or
pnpm dlx @otso-run/create-otso
```

**Prompts:**

- Project type: *Minimal site / Personal archive / Team instance*
- Database: *SQLite (local) / Postgres*
- Sync targets: *Micropub / Filesystem / Both*
- Starter plugins (checkbox list)
- Generates:
	- `otso.config.ts`
	- `.env.example`
	- `docker-compose.yml` (optional)
	- First run scripts and sample content

---

# Configuration & environments

Top-level config file for deployments:

```
// otso.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@otso-run/core";

export default defineConfig({
  storage: { driver: "sqlite", file: "./data/otso.db" },
  media: { dir: "./media" },
  plugins: [
    "@otso-run/plugin-source-github",
    "otso-plugin-target-micropub"
  ],
  transforms: [
    "@otso-run/plugin-transform-exif"
  ],
});
```

---

# CI/CD & quality gates (monorepo)

- **ci.yml**
	- Install (pnpm), build, typecheck, lint, unit tests, affected packages only (Turbo cache).
- **release.yml**
	- Changesets versioning + publish to npm on `main`.
- **e2e-plugins-matrix.yml**
	- Matrix over a curated set of community plugins (pulled from `plugins/registry.json`) to run smoke tests against `@otso-run/core@canary`.
- **Preview** (Vercel/Netlify) for `web/` docs on PRs.

---

# Docs & website

- Use **Astro Starlight** (great IA, MDX, fast).
- Sections: *Start*, *Concepts*, *CLI*, *Server*, *Plugin Dev*, *Registry*, *Cookbook*, *Self-hosting*.
- Auto-generate API docs (TypeDoc) and schema pages from `@otso-run/schema`.

---

# Issue hygiene & governance

- **Labels:** `area:core`, `area:cli`, `area:server`, `type:plugin`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `breaking-change`.
- **RFCs:** `/rfcs/YYYY-<slug>.md` in the monorepo with a lightweight template.
- **CODEOWNERS:** core & API owned by you + maintainers; plugins can list additional owners.

---

# When to keep a plugin in the monorepo vs its own repo

- **Monorepo** if: it‚Äôs essential, broadly useful, you want synchronized releases, or it relies on internal APIs that change often.
- **Separate repo** if: it‚Äôs niche, experimental, or owned by a community maintainer. Those go in the `plugins` registry and get tested via the matrix CI.

---

# Naming conventions (quick ref)

- First-party: `@otso-run/<area>-<name>`
	- `plugin-<type>-<name>` (e.g., `plugin-source-github`)
	- `adapter-<kind>-<name>` (e.g., `adapter-db-sqlite`)
- Third-party: `otso-plugin-<type>-<name>` (any scope). Must include `otso.plugin.json`.

---

# First steps you can do today

1. Create the **`otso`** monorepo with pnpm + Turborepo + Changesets.
2. Scaffold packages: `core`, `cli`, `server`, `web`, `schema`, `create-otso`.
3. Add **one** sample source plugin and **one** target plugin inside `/packages/plugins`.
4. Publish `@otso-run/create-otso` with one starter kit.
5. Ship `plugins/registry.json` + docs page rendering it.
6. Add the **plugin template** repo and link it from docs.

If you want, I can draft the initial `package.json` workspaces, `turbo.json`, and a tiny `OtsoPlugin` TS interface to drop in.

##### You said:

what should the otso github repo tagline be

###### ChatGPT said:

For the main `otso` repo tagline you‚Äôll want something short, inviting, and descriptive ‚Äî clear enough for newcomers, but still with personality. Here are some directions you could take:

**Concise & practical**

- *‚ÄúLocal-first IndieWeb toolkit for publishing, syncing, and archiving.‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúMicropub server, PESOS/POSES CLI, and extensions for the IndieWeb.‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúFast, local-first publishing with Micropub and Webmention.‚Äù*

**Evocative & friendly**

- *‚ÄúOne trail, shared openly.‚Äù* (ties to your earlier bear/forest theme üêª)
- *‚ÄúLocal-first publishing that runs with you.‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúYour personal trailhead for the IndieWeb.‚Äù*

**Balanced middle ground**

- *‚ÄúLocal-first IndieWeb toolkit ‚Äî Micropub, POSSE/PESOS, and plugins.‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúA clean, fast, extensible publishing core for the IndieWeb.‚Äù*

üëâ I‚Äôd suggest something like:  
**‚ÄúLocal-first IndieWeb toolkit ‚Äî Micropub, PESOS, and plugins.‚Äù**  
It‚Äôs clear to developers browsing GitHub, hits your core values (local-first, IndieWeb, extensibility), and leaves room for Otso‚Äôs bear/trail identity in the README/branding.

Do you want the tagline to lean more **developer-oriented** (tooling/tech stack) or more **user-oriented** (freedom, owning your content, IndieWeb philosophy)?

##### You said:

what license should I use

###### ChatGPT said:

That depends on how you want Otso to spread and what obligations you want others to have when they extend or reuse it. Here‚Äôs the decision space:

---

## 1\. Very permissive (max adoption, few obligations)

- **MIT** ‚Äì the default in the JS ecosystem. Extremely permissive, simple. Anyone can use/modify/relicense, only attribution required.
- **Apache 2.0** ‚Äì like MIT but adds explicit patent grants + protection. Safer if you think companies may build on Otso commercially.

üëâ Best if: you want Otso used as widely as possible, including commercial deployments, with no ‚Äúcopyleft‚Äù obligations.

---

## 2\. Protective copyleft (extensions must stay open)

- **GPLv3** ‚Äì any derivative work (plugins, forks, modified versions) must also be GPLv3. Strong copyleft. Can discourage commercial embedding.
- **AGPLv3** ‚Äì even stricter: if someone runs Otso as a hosted service, they must publish their source code. Popular with ‚Äúnetwork software‚Äù to prevent closed SaaS clones.

üëâ Best if: you want to guarantee Otso remains open, even when others build SaaS products around it.

---

## 3\. Middle ground

- **LGPLv3** ‚Äì ‚Äúweak copyleft.‚Äù Core must stay open, but plugins and software linking to it can be under any license.
- **MPL 2.0** ‚Äì file-level copyleft. If someone modifies a file in Otso, they must share that file back. But they can keep larger surrounding code closed.

üëâ Best if: you want some reciprocity but don‚Äôt want to scare off plugin developers or integrators.

---

## Practical norms for projects like Otso

- **Core frameworks/toolkits** usually go **MIT or Apache 2.0** to maximize extension ecosystems.
- **Plugins/examples** can follow the same license or vary.
- If you worry about someone making a closed-source ‚ÄúOtso SaaS,‚Äù **AGPL** is the guardrail.
- If you just want credit and community but don‚Äôt mind SaaS adoption, **Apache 2.0** is a good balance.

---

‚úÖ My recommendation for Otso:  
**Apache 2.0** ‚Äî it‚Äôs permissive, business-friendly, protects against patent trolls, and is widely trusted.  
Then: encourage (but not force) plugin developers to use the same.

If you later want to **dual license** (e.g., core Apache 2.0, but server distribution AGPL), you can, but starting with Apache 2.0 keeps momentum.

---

Do you want Otso to stay maximally open *even if someone runs it as a hosted service* (AGPL territory), or is your priority adoption and plugin ecosystem growth (Apache/MIT)?

##### You said:

any risk if I start with non aand choose a license later?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚Äî there are a few risks in waiting:

---

### 1\. **Default = All Rights Reserved**

If you publish code with *no license*, the legal default is *all rights reserved*.

- Nobody (outside of you) can legally use, copy, modify, or redistribute it.
- That means contributors can‚Äôt safely send PRs, and others can‚Äôt experiment with your code.
- It limits adoption and can create awkward ‚Äúis this safe?‚Äù questions for potential users.

---

### 2\. **Contributor agreements get messy**

If others contribute before you pick a license:

- Their contributions are under ‚Äúno license‚Äù too.
- When you later choose a license, you technically need their consent to apply it retroactively.
- If you don‚Äôt get it, you may have a patchwork of code under different implicit terms.

---

### 3\. **Perception & trust**

- Developers and orgs usually avoid projects with no license because they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre allowed to do.
- Choosing a license early signals intent and helps build confidence in the ecosystem.

---

### 4\. **Re-licensing later is possible, but‚Ä¶**

- If you are the **only contributor**, you can change the license anytime.
- Once you have multiple contributors, you need their approval (or a Contributor License Agreement system in place).
- Projects sometimes get ‚Äústuck‚Äù because they can‚Äôt reach every contributor to approve a switch.

---

‚úÖ **Low-risk option if you‚Äôre undecided:**  
Start with something *permissive and flexible* (MIT or Apache 2.0). That way:

- Others can start using and contributing without fear.
- You preserve the option to dual-license or tighten terms later (e.g., adding AGPL for the hosted server).

---

Would you like me to suggest a **hybrid approach** (e.g. MIT/Apache for the core, but AGPL for the server) that keeps your ecosystem open but still protects against someone just repackaging Otso as a closed SaaS?

##### You said:

what about using bun vs pnpm

###### ChatGPT said:

Short answer: **use pnpm for the package manager** (monorepo-friendly, boring-reliable), and feel free to **support Bun as a fast runtime/test runner** where it‚Äôs compatible. That combo gives you speed *and* ecosystem smoothness.

---

# Bun vs pnpm ‚Äî what matters for Otso

| Concern | pnpm (manager) | Bun (manager/runtime) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Monorepo workspaces** | Excellent (filters, `workspace:*`, hoist control). | Works, but fewer knobs; some tools assume npm/pnpm semantics. |
| **Deterministic installs** | Battle-tested lockfile; content-addressable store; great CI caching. | Fast, but occasional compat gaps with complex `postinstall`, native addons, or unusual Node resolution edge cases. |
| **Ecosystem expectations** | Most templates/CLIs/docs assume npm/yarn/**pnpm**. | Improving quickly, but you‚Äôll still find ‚Äúonly works with npm/pnpm‚Äù moments. |
| **Speed** | Very fast, especially with a shared store + Turbo cache. | Often fastest for local installs and scripts. |
| **Node compatibility** | N/A (uses Node). | 95%+ for many projects, but native modules or older Node APIs can bite. |
| **Tooling surface** | Package manager only. | Manager + runtime + test runner + bundler (`bun test`, `bunx`, `bun build`). |
| **Windows/macOS/Linux** | Solid everywhere. | Solid on macOS/Linux; Windows support has matured but still has occasional sharp edges in some stacks. |

---

## Recommended setup

**1) Standardize on pnpm for installs + lockfile**

- Predictable CI, easiest contributor onramp.
- Keep the door open to run with Bun locally where it works.

**2) Allow Bun for scripts/tests (opt-in)**  
If a contributor has Bun, they can run `bun test` or `bun run dev`; otherwise Node+pnpm is the default.

### Root `package.json`

```
{
  "name": "otso",
  "private": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9",            // pin via Corepack
  "engines": { "node": ">=18.17" },      // or >=20 if you prefer
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install || true",

    "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel",
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
    "release": "changeset publish",

    // Optional: speed boost for those with Bun installed
    "dev:bun": "bunx turbo run dev --parallel",
    "test:bun": "bunx turbo run test"
  }
}
```

### `.npmrc` (root)

```
strict-peer-dependencies=true
auto-install-peers=false
prefer-offline=true
```

### `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

```
packages:
  - packages/*
  - packages/*/*
  - examples/*
  - e2e/*
```

### `turbo.json` (keep it manager-agnostic)

```
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": { "cache": true, "dependsOn": ["^build"], "outputs": ["dist/**"] },
    "dev":   { "cache": false },
    "test":  { "cache": true,  "dependsOn": ["build"] },
    "lint":  { "cache": true }
  }
}
```

---

## Scripts inside packages

Prefer `tsx`/`tsup`/`vitest` which run fine under Node or Bun.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup src/index.ts --dts --format esm,cjs",
    "dev": "tsx watch src/dev.ts",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "lint": "biome check ."
  }
}
```

If a subpackage wants Bun speed for tests, you can add:

```
{ "scripts": { "test:bun": "bun test" } }
```

‚Ä¶but keep `"test"` pointing at `vitest` so CI is consistent.

---

## CI advice

- Use **pnpm** for install + caching across the whole monorepo.
- Optionally add a small **Bun job** to catch incompat issues early:
```
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (excerpt)
jobs:
  node-pnpm:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20', cache: 'pnpm' }
      - run: corepack enable
      - run: pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm -w build && pnpm -w test

  bun-smoke:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with: { bun-version: 'latest' }
      - run: bun i
      - run: bunx turbo run build
      - run: bunx turbo run test
```

(If Bun smoke ever fails for a niche package, you can skip it there with a package-level script guard.)

---

## Developer experience tips

- **Pin tool versions** (Corepack for pnpm; `engines` for Node) so `create-otso` users get consistent results.
- **Use workspace ranges** (`"@otso-run/core": "workspace:*"`) for first-party deps.
- **Keep hoisting predictable**: pnpm‚Äôs default strict layout helps you catch missing deps early.
- **Document the dual path**: README ‚ÄúUse pnpm; Bun optional for speed.‚Äù

---

## Bottom line

- For Otso‚Äôs **monorepo + templates + plugin ecosystem**, **pnpm** is the safest default.
- Embrace **Bun as a turbo button** (runtime/test) where it‚Äôs compatible, without making it the gatekeeper for contributors or CI.
- If, down the road, everything proves Bun-happy, you can flip the default; starting pnpm-first avoids day-one friction.
