Snapshots let you rewind if a migration goes wrong.

## Create a snapshot

```bash
otso db snapshot before-migration
```

## List and inspect

```bash
otso db snapshots
otso db inspect before-migration
```

## Restore

```bash
otso db restore before-migration
```

Verify the database state and rerun any failed operations.
