In this tutorial you'll install Otso and pick a simple place to begin.

## Install prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

Then install:

```bash
pnpm install -g otso
```

## Initialize workspace

```bash
otso init mysite
cd mysite
```

## Choose your path

After setup, try one of these common tasks:

### Archive a Twitter export

Save a local copy of your tweets.

```bash
otso import twitter --archive ~/Downloads/twitter
```

See [Import Twitter/X Archive](/guides/import-twitter-archives/) for details.

### Sync your Mastodon posts

Pull in new activity you’ve posted elsewhere.

```bash
otso import mastodon --since 7d
```

More options in [Import from Mastodon](/guides/import-mastodon/).

### See your music listening trends together

Bring in listens and playlists from Apple Music, Spotify, and Last.fm, then explore them in one collection.

```bash
otso import apple-music ~/Downloads/apple-music.zip
otso import spotify --since 30d
otso import lastfm --since 30d
otso dedupe resolve
```

Open the web UI to view unified playlists and listening trends.

### Publish a note and cross-post to Bluesky

Send a post to your site and Bluesky at once.

```bash
otso publish hello.md --to bluesky
```

Follow [Publish via Micropub](/guides/publish-micropub/) and [Publish to Bluesky](/guides/publish-bluesky/) to configure IndieAuth and endpoints.

Pick another path anytime—Otso lets you roam.
