In this tutorial you'll install Otso and pick a simple place to begin.

## Install prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

Then install:

```bash
pnpm install -g otso
```

## Initialize workspace

```bash
otso init mysite
cd mysite
```

## Choose your path

After setup, try one of these common tasks:

### Archive a Twitter/X export and publish to your own site

Save a local copy of your tweets then publish them on your site.

```bash
otso import twitter --archive ~/Downloads/twitter
otso publish site
```

See [Import Twitter/X Archive](/guides/import-twitter-archives/) for details.

### Automatically sync your Mastodon posts, likes, and replies to your website and local storage

Run this as a PESOS job—like Bridgy or Echofeed—to pull your Mastodon
activity into your local archive and mirror it to your site. You can run
it locally on demand or deploy it as a scheduled job on a serverless or
cron service.

```bash
otso import mastodon --include likes,replies --since 7d
otso publish site
```

Deploy a recurring import every 15 minutes on Vercel:

```bash
otso run --every 15m --on vercel import mastodon --include likes,replies
```

More options in [Import from Mastodon](/guides/import-mastodon/).

### Publish a note on your website and cross-post it to Bluesky and Mastodon

Send a post to your site, Bluesky, and Mastodon at once.

```bash
otso publish hello.md --to bluesky,mastodon
```

Follow [Publish via Micropub](/guides/publish-micropub/), [Publish to Bluesky](/guides/publish-bluesky/), and [Publish to Mastodon](/guides/publish-mastodon/) to configure endpoints.

### Tag your bookmarks from Pinboard and Readwise using a local AI model

Import bookmarks then enrich them with tags from a local model.

```bash
otso import pinboard --since 30d
otso import readwise --since 30d
otso enrich tags --model local
```

See [Import Bookmarks & Enrich with Defuddle](/tutorials/import-bookmarks-defuddle/) for more on cleaning up bookmarks.

### Generate searchable descriptions from your screenshots folder

Pull images from a folder and auto‑caption them for search.

```bash
otso import folder ~/Pictures/Screenshots
otso enrich describe --model local
```

Pick another path anytime—Otso lets you roam.
