Otso treats every change as an immutable event. This makes history auditable and projections easy to rebuild.

## Why events work for Otso

- Simplifies imports from unreliable APIs.
- Enables replay and migration to new projections.
- Encourages small, composable plugins.

## Drawbacks and mitigations

- Event logs grow forever → use snapshots or pruning for old events.
- Higher initial complexity → start with high level helpers like `createEvent`.

## Practical rules of thumb

1. Capture the smallest meaningful fact as an event.
2. Keep events immutable; derive views elsewhere.
3. Name projections after the query they serve (e.g., `latest_notes`).
