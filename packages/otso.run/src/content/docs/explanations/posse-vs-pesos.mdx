title: POSSE vs PESOS
description: When to syndicate out vs. import back.
---

Two common IndieWeb workflows:

- **POSSE** – Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.
- **PESOS** – Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate to Own Site.

## When to use POSSE

Use when you control the canonical post and want copies on silos. Otso publishes to your site first and then cross‑posts.

## When to use PESOS

Useful when a silo offers tools you need. Import the content and keep a canonical copy in Otso.

## Hybrid workflows

You can mix both: POSSE your own posts while PESOS likes or replies made on other networks. Otso tracks origin for each event so projections stay consistent.
