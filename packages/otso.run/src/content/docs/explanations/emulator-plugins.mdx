description: Browse local backups through platform-like interfaces.

Emulator plugins let Otso display exported data with a UI that mirrors the service it came from. Each plugin interprets a platform's layout and metadata so that browsing a local archive feels like using the original site.

## How it works
1. **Local backup** – content and metadata are stored offline.
2. **Source-specific plugin** – knows the platform's structure and reproduces its look and behavior.
3. **Uniform shell** – multiple plugins run in the same host so you can switch between emulated interfaces.
4. **Interactive browsing** – search, filter, and follow links entirely on local data.

## Advantages
- Familiar interface for archived content.
- Backups remain accessible even if the original service disappears.
- All browsing happens locally for privacy and control.
- Developers can add plugins for new platforms.

## Inspirations
- **parallel-flickr** – a reconstruction of Flickr’s photo pages that demonstrates how a backup can feel like the live site.
- **N64 emulators** – recreate console hardware in software so classic games remain playable on modern machines.
- **Rhizome Web Recorder** – captures entire browsing sessions for later playback, preserving not just files but the experience.

## Why Emulate?
Plain archives keep data, but they lose context. Emulating an interface revives the look, behavior, and cultural feel of a platform so that a backup becomes something you can inhabit, not just inspect.
