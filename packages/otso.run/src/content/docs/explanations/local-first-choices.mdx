Running locally keeps your data fast and private.

## Benefits

- Works offline and syncs when convenient.
- Easy to inspect and back up the entire database.
- No vendor lock‑in.

## Trade‑offs

- You manage backups and updates yourself.
- Collaborative editing requires extra tooling.

## Practices

- Use Git to version configuration and content.
- Sync databases with Litestream, LiteFS, or regular snapshots.
- Export and re‑import when moving between machines.
