description: How Otso supports IndieWeb principles.
---

Otso builds on IndieWeb protocols and encourages publishing on your own domain first.

## Principles embraced

- **Own your data** – everything lives in a local database you control.
- **Publish first** – your site is the source of truth; POSSE pushes copies out.
- **PESOS optional** – you can import from silos without surrendering ownership.

## Protocol support

- **Micropub** for publishing.
- **Webmention** for replies, likes, and reposts.
- **Microformats2** for semantic HTML.

## Extending the IndieWeb

By keeping sources, enrichments, and publishing logic pluggable, Otso allows experimentation while staying interoperable with existing IndieWeb tools.
