Twitter’s shifting APIs and export formats require extra care.

## API limits

- The v2 API enforces tight rate limits; use cursor‑based pagination and retry with backoff.
- OAuth tokens expire—store refresh tokens securely.

## Archive quirks

- Exports arrive as a ZIP containing a `data/` directory with tweet JSON.
- Media files may need to be fetched separately; URLs can expire.

## Recommendations

- Prefer the official archive when available; it’s more complete than scraping.
- Cache responses locally to avoid hitting limits.
- Map retweets and quoted tweets to `repost` and `mention` kinds respectively.
