title: Ecosystem — Alternatives & Inspirations
description: A friendly tour of related projects and ideas that informed Otso.

This page highlights projects that overlap with Otso or inspired parts of it. It’s not a feature-by-feature comparison—more a map of “when to use what,” with links to explore.

## IndieWeb foundations

- Micropub — write API for your site. https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
- IndieAuth — authentication for IndieWeb services. https://indieauth.net/
- Webmention — cross-site replies/likes. https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/
- Microformats2 — semantic HTML for posts. https://microformats.org/

Otso speaks these standards. That lets you mix-and-match tools without losing control of your data.

## Micropub servers and hosts

- Indiekit — Micropub server you can self-host. https://indiekit.indieweb.org/
  - Great when you want a server that connects your site to services and handles media/syndication.
  - Otso vs Indiekit: Otso adds an event store + import/sync layer (PESOS) and rebuildable projections. Indiekit is a slimmer Micropub server—perfect if that’s all you need.

- Micro.blog — hosted IndieWeb blogging (Micropub, feeds, export). https://micro.blog/
  - Best for a simple Micropub-powered blog with built-in social. Otso can publish to or import from Micro.blog.

- WordPress — huge ecosystem; REST/XML‑RPC, WXR export. https://wordpress.org/
- Ghost — modern publishing; Admin API, JSON export, feeds. https://ghost.org/
  - In Otso’s docs, both appear as common publish and import targets (POSSE/PESOS). Use them as your public site while Otso keeps a local archive and sync.

## Local-first notes & static content

- Obsidian / Markdown repos — file-based workflows with git sync. https://obsidian.md/
  - Great when you want plain files first. Otso can export projections to Markdown or read Markdown as a source; when you need richer queries, snapshots, or imports from APIs, Otso’s small DB helps.

## Sources to sync (PESOS)

From the planning notes and limits roundup:

- Mastodon — publish (Micropub-compatible targets) and import via API/archives.
- Bluesky — app password auth + cursor pagination.
- Twitter/X — tiered APIs and strict limits; archives remain useful.
- GitHub — activity feeds and Atom; straightforward mapping to kinds.
- Readwise — highlight sync via API and CSV export. https://readwise.io/
- Pinboard/Raindrop/Pocket — bookmarks and saved links as import sources.

Otso’s import layer aims for idempotent upserts and clear mappings (notes, replies, bookmarks, photos, etc.).

## Search & scheduling

- Pagefind — default static-site search (bundled by Starlight). https://pagefind.app/
- Algolia DocSearch — hosted search for docs sites. https://docsearch.algolia.com/
- Vercel Cron Jobs — schedule periodic syncs. https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs
- Upstash QStash — serverless queueing for retries/fan-out. https://upstash.com/qstash

## Local-first data & sync (inspiration)

- Litestream / LiteFS — SQLite replication + file-level sync. https://litestream.io/ • https://fly.io/docs/litefs/
- ElectricSQL — CRDT‑powered sync (SQLite ⇄ Postgres) for true offline multi‑writer apps. https://electric-sql.com/
- Datasette — simple, explorable SQLite apps; inspiration for “queryable archives.” https://datasette.io/

These aren’t drop‑in “alternatives” to Otso, but they influenced the recommended storage/sync paths in the docs (e.g., start with SQLite + snapshots; add replication; consider ElectricSQL if you need real multi‑device editing).

## How to choose

- You only need Micropub: Indiekit or a hosted Micropub‑friendly site (e.g., Micro.blog) may be enough.
- You want an owned archive + imports: Otso’s CLI + store gives you idempotent sync, projections, and safety (snapshots).
- You want both: Use Otso for ingest/publish and keep your existing site. POSSE to networks; PESOS imports bring history home.

If a project here should be added or corrected, open an issue with a link and a quick note on how you use it.
