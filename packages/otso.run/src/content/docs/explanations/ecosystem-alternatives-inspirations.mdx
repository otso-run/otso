title: Ecosystem — Alternatives & Inspirations
description: How Otso compares to adjacent projects, with gratitude and links for deeper dives.

Otso lives happily in an ecosystem of IndieWeb and local‑first tools. This page summarizes how Otso differs, when you might choose something else, and how they can play together. We link out with admiration—these projects are great.

## How Otso differs (at a glance)

- Otso is an event‑driven, local‑first toolkit: import (PESOS), publish (Micropub/POSSE), keep a durable archive (SQLite/Postgres), and build fast projections you can rebuild when needed.
- Many adjacent tools are excellent at one slice (e.g., Micropub server, hosted site, file‑based notes). Otso complements them when you want import/sync + ownership in one place.

## Micropub servers and hosted platforms

- Indiekit ([site](https://indiekit.indieweb.org/)) — a lovely Micropub server you can self‑host. Use it when you want a slim server that speaks Micropub, handles media, and connects to services. Otso adds an event store, import/sync, and projections; you can still publish to an Indiekit‑powered site.

- Micro.blog ([site](https://micro.blog/)) — generous hosted IndieWeb blogging with Micropub, feeds, and export. If you want a turnkey home, Micro.blog is a joy. Otso can publish to it and import your archive so you retain your history.

- WordPress ([site](https://wordpress.org/)) and Ghost ([site](https://ghost.org/)) — both are fantastic publishing platforms. Keep them as your public site while Otso maintains a local archive, runs imports, and syndicates out. Best of both worlds.

## Local‑first notes and static content

- Obsidian/Markdown ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), Git repos, static sites) — plain files are comforting and powerful. Keep them! Otso can export Markdown projections or read Markdown sources. When you need consistent kinds, imports from APIs, search, or snapshots, Otso’s small database helps without taking that simplicity away.

## Sources and targets (friends, not competitors)

Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter/X, GitHub, Readwise, Pinboard/Raindrop/Pocket—these are where your stuff already lives. Otso treats them as import and/or publish endpoints:

- Mastodon — POSSE and import via APIs/archives.
- Bluesky — app‑password auth + cursor pagination.
- Twitter/X — tight API limits; archives remain valuable.
- GitHub — activity feeds map cleanly to kinds.
- Readwise — highlight sync from API/CSV.

The focus is idempotent upserts, clear mappings (notes, replies, bookmarks, photos), and safe re‑runs.

## Search and scheduling

- Pagefind ([site](https://pagefind.app/)) — fast, local static search (Starlight’s default). Great for docs.
- Algolia DocSearch ([site](https://docsearch.algolia.com/)) — hosted search for docs; easy if you’re in the DocSearch program.
- Vercel Cron ([docs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs)) and Upstash QStash ([site](https://upstash.com/qstash)) — nice ways to automate sync/retries without heavy infra.

## Local‑first sync inspirations

- Litestream ([site](https://litestream.io/)) / LiteFS ([docs](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/)) — pragmatic SQLite replication. Lovely for “SQLite as source of truth.”
- ElectricSQL ([site](https://electric-sql.com/)) — CRDT‑powered sync (SQLite ⇄ Postgres) for true multi‑device, offline editing. Reach for it when you need collaborative editing beyond simple imports.
- Datasette ([site](https://datasette.io/)) — a delight for exploring/querying SQLite. Inspires Otso’s “queryable archive” feel.

## Standards we share (the glue)

- Micropub ([spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/)) — write API for your site.
- IndieAuth ([site](https://indieauth.net/)) — authentication for IndieWeb services.
- Webmention ([spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)) — cross‑site replies/likes.
- Microformats2 ([site](https://microformats.org/)) — semantic HTML for posts.

Otso speaks these, so you can mix tools without losing ownership.

## When to reach for what

- “I just need Micropub.” Use [Indiekit](https://indiekit.indieweb.org/) or a hosted Micropub‑friendly home like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).
- “I want an owned archive + imports.” Use Otso for ingest, snapshots, projections, and optional POSSE.
- “I want both.” Keep your public site (WordPress, Ghost, Micro.blog) and let Otso import history, publish new posts, and keep everything searchable.
