Track your commits, issues, and stars.

## Token and permissions

Create a personal access token with `repo` and `read:user` scopes and store it in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Fetch events

```bash
otso import github <username>
```

The importer walks the Events API and upserts each action.

## Mapping

- Push and merge events → `entry` with commit URLs.
- Issues and PRs → `entry` with labels mapped to tags.
- Stars → `bookmark` events.

## Rate limits

GitHub allows 5k requests/hour. The importer sleeps and resumes when limits are reached.
