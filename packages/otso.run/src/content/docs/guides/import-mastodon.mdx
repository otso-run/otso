## Using the API

1. Create an access token in Mastodon preferences.
2. Set `MASTODON_TOKEN` and `MASTODON_INSTANCE` in your environment.
3. Run `otso import mastodon --since 2024-01-01`.

## Using the archive

Download your account archive, unzip, and run:

```bash
otso import mastodon --archive ~/Downloads/mastodon-export
```

## Run as a PESOS job

`otso import mastodon` is idempotent, so you can run it regularly to keep
your site and local archive up to date. Execute it on demand or deploy it
to a cron or serverless worker to poll Mastodon on a schedule and sync the
results back to your local environment.

Use `otso run` to deploy the import on a timer, for example every 15 minutes
on Vercel:

```bash
otso run --every 15m --on vercel import mastodon --include likes,replies
```

## Mapping

- Toots → `note`
- Replies → `reply` with `inReplyTo` URL.
- Boosts → `repost`
- Favorites → `like`

Media attachments are downloaded and referenced as `media` entries.
