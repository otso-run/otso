title: Configure Visibility
description: Use public, unlisted, private, and secret visibility.
---

Events carry a `visibility` property to control where content appears.

## Visibility options

- `public` – visible in feeds and search.
- `unlisted` – not listed but accessible via permalink.
- `private` – kept in local tools only.
- `secret` – encrypted or restricted projections.

## Set defaults

Define a default in `otsorc.yml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  visibility: unlisted
```

## Override per item

Pass a flag to the CLI when creating or importing:

```bash
otso publish note.md --visibility private
```

## Effects

- Only `public` items are syndicated or exposed via APIs.
- Search indexes exclude `private` and `secret` content.
- Changing visibility emits a new event, allowing audit of who saw what.
