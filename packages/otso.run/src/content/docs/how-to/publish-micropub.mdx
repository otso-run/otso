## IndieAuth

1. Ensure your site advertises IndieAuth endpoints.
2. Run `otso login <micropub-endpoint>` to obtain a token.

## Configure endpoint

Set the token and endpoint in `otsorc.yml`:

```yaml
micropub:
  endpoint: https://example.com/micropub
  token: $INDIEAUTH_TOKEN
```

## Publish

```bash
otso publish note.md
```

Otso sends a Micropub create request with content and media. Responses include the canonical URL which becomes the eventâ€™s permalink.
