title: Import from Bluesky
description: Import from Bluesky with cursor-based pagination.
---

Otsoâ€™s Bluesky adapter pulls posts via the public API.

## Obtain credentials

1. Create an app password in Bluesky settings.
2. Set `BSKY_IDENTIFIER` and `BSKY_PASSWORD` in your environment.

## Run the import

```bash
otso import bluesky --cursor latest.json
```

The adapter stores the last cursor so subsequent runs resume where they left off.

## Mapping

- Posts become `note` events with AT URIs stored as `external_id`.
- Images are downloaded and attached as media.
- Embeds to external URLs become `bookmark` events.
