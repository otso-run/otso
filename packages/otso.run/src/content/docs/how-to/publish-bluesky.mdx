## Setup

1. Create an app password in Bluesky.
2. Set `BSKY_IDENTIFIER` and `BSKY_PASSWORD`.

## Publish a post

```bash
otso publish bluesky 1234
```

The command takes an existing event ID and posts it to Bluesky, including a link to the canonical URL.

## Limits

- Posts max 300 characters; longer posts are truncated.
- Attach up to four images.
- Bluesky does not yet support alt text via API, so Otso embeds descriptions in the post body.
