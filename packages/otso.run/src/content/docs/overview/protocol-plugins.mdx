Otso treats network protocols as pluggable modules. A protocol plugin defines how the core speaks a standard like Micropub or Webmention, and multiple publishers can build on top of it.

Current and planned protocol plugins include:

- Micropub client and optional server.
- Webmention send/receive.
- WebSub for push feeds.
- ActivityPub bridge for the Fediverse.
- Experimental ideas such as AT Protocol, Nostr, or IPFS.

Protocol plugins power publishers: an ActivityPub plugin can serve both Mastodon importers and posting adapters.
