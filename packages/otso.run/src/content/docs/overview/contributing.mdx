We welcome contributions of all kinds and from contributors of every background. Whether you're writing code, improving documentation, shaping user experience, reporting issues, offering translations, or fostering community discussions, your help moves the project forward. If you're new to open source, you're welcome hereâ€”start with our issue tracker, ask questions, and share your ideas.

## Open Source Philosophy

Otso is built in the open to empower individuals and communities. We believe software should be transparent, forkable, and shaped by those who use it. By sharing our work and collaborating publicly, we strive to create tools that respect privacy, encourage portability, and grow through collective stewardship.
