title: Why Otso
description: The value of owning your content and using open standards.
---

You create across many places, but platforms change, rate limits move, and export tools are an afterthought. Otso helps you keep a durable, portable archive you control, while still meeting people where they are.

## Own the source, share widely

- Your site holds the canonical copy. POSSE cross‑posts link back to it.
- PESOS imports bring old posts home so you can search and reuse them.
- Webmention connects conversations without ceding ownership.

## Local‑first reliability

- Works offline with SQLite and file assets; easy to back up or sync.
- Snapshots and idempotent commands make big operations safe and reversible.
- Projections are rebuildable, so damage is contained and recoverable.

## Standards and interoperability

- Micropub + IndieAuth for publishing and auth; Microformats2 for semantic HTML.
- Plays nicely with IndieWeb tools and other ecosystems.

## Understand and control your data

- Transparent, event‑driven internals—see what happened and why.
- Clear privacy rules: public, unlisted, private, secret.
- No secrets in indexes; credentials live in env or OS keychain.

## Why not “just Markdown in git”?

Git + Markdown is great for static content. Otso handles streams of activity, imports from APIs, media management, visibility rules, and cross‑posting—with a small database that makes queries and enrichment fast. You can still keep Markdown projections for portability, but a real store gives you power and safety.

- Own your data in a durable local‑first store.
- Publish anywhere while keeping your site as the source.
- Built on open standards (Micropub, IndieAuth, Webmention).
- Extensible plugins and safe operations.
