The Otso iOS app focuses on one-thumb publishing. It stores drafts locally, syncs in the background, and supports the full Micropub post kinds.

- IndieAuth login with multi-account support.
- Compose notes, articles, photos, replies, reposts, likes, bookmarks, check-ins, and RSVPs.
- Local-first engine with SQLite drafts and an outbox queue for retryable sync.
- Built with Swift and modern SwiftUI patterns.
