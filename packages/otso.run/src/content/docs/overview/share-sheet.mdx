A share extension lets any app hand content to Otso. From Safari, Photos, or a reader, choose Otso in the share sheet to create a draft instantly.

- Accepts text, URLs, images, or files.
- Prompts for post kind before queuing the item.
- Works with Shortcuts and App Intents for quick capture flows.
- Respects the same local-first queue as the main app.
