AI features in Otso are opt-in. You can run local models or connect to hosted ones to enrich your archive.

- Generate summaries, keywords, or alt-text for imports.
- Produce cleaned reading views for saved links.
- Store provenance so you can redo enrichment with better models later.
- Completely optionalâ€”the core works without any AI.
