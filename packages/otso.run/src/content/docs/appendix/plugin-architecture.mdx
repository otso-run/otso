Otso plugins extend imports, publishers, and enrichers. A plugin is a Node module exporting a manifest and hooks.

## Discovery and manifest

Plugins are discovered via `package.json` using the `"otso"` field or by loading from the local `plugins/` directory.

Example manifest:

```ts
export const manifest = {
  name: 'example',
  version: '1.0.0',
  hooks: ['import', 'publish']
};
```

## Minimal plugin interface

```ts
import type { ImportHook } from 'otso';

export const importHook: ImportHook = async (ctx) => {
  // fetch data and yield events
};
```

Hook functions receive a context with logging, storage, and config helpers.

## Examples and testing

- Use `pnpm link` during development.
- Provide fixtures for APIs and run `pnpm test` inside your plugin repo.
- See `@otso/import-github` for a real world example.
