title: Deployment Recipes
description: Vercel, self‑hosted, and scheduling.

Otso runs as a small Node app and does not require special infrastructure. These deployment recipes cover common setups.

## Vercel

1. Fork the repository and push your content.
2. In the Vercel dashboard, import the repo.
3. Add environment variables (`OTSO_DB_URL`, `OTSO_SECRET`, etc.).
4. Enable the schedule function if using QStash.
5. Trigger a deploy and verify the site responds.

## Self‑hosted

- Install Node and a database on your server.
- Clone the repo and run `pnpm install && pnpm build`.
- Use systemd or pm2 to run `pnpm start` as a service.
- Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) with HTTPS.

## Scheduling

Use cron or QStash to run syncs periodically:

```bash
# crontab -e
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/otso sync >> ~/otso.log 2>&1
```

On Vercel with Upstash QStash:

1. Create a QStash URL that hits `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/sync`.
2. Set the schedule (e.g., hourly).
3. Monitor invocation logs to ensure sync jobs complete.
