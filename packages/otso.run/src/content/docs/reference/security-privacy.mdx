Otso is designed to keep sensitive data local and under your control.

## Secrets management

- Load API keys from environment variables or the OS keychain.
- Never commit secrets to the repository.
- Use `.env` for local development and hosting dashboards for production.

## Visibility rules

Each event has a `visibility` field:

- `public` – included in feeds and search.
- `unlisted` – accessible via permalink but excluded from lists.
- `private` – visible only in local tools.
- `secret` – stored encrypted; not exported.

## Backup and encryption

- Keep regular database snapshots.
- For SQLite, pair backups with tools like Litestream or LiteFS.
- Encrypt archives at rest using `age` or similar tools when storing off‑device.
