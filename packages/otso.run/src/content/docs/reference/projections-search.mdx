description: Policies for projections, indexing, and fullâ€‘text search.
---

Projections provide fast read models derived from events.

## What to index

- Public and unlisted items.
- Selected fields like `content.text`, `tags`, and `published_at`.
- Exclude secrets and private content.

## Search adapters

Otso ships with a SQLite FTS5 adapter and can emit JSON for external search services.

Rebuild projections when schemas change:

```bash
otso projections rebuild
```

## Privacy considerations

Never index API keys or other sensitive values. Visibility rules are enforced when building search indexes.
