title: Storage Adapters
description: FS‑Markdown, JSONL, SQLite, and Postgres adapters.
---

Otso ships with multiple storage backends.

## Adapter interfaces

All adapters expose `put(event)`, `get(id)`, and `query(...)` methods. Custom adapters implement this interface.

## Built-in adapters

- **SQLite** – default local store; supports FTS and transactions.
- **Postgres** – for multi-user or hosted setups.
- **FS-Markdown** – writes events as Markdown files for simple sites.
- **JSONL** – append events to a newline-delimited log.

## Trade-offs

| Adapter | Pros | Cons |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| SQLite | Simple, fast | Single writer |
| Postgres | Scales, concurrent | Requires server |
| FS-Markdown | Human-readable | Limited querying |
