Beyond the bundled apps, Otso exposes its Micropub implementation and plugin system as headless services.

- `@otso/protocol-micropub` provides a Micropub client and optional server.
- Plugins register capabilities such as storage, publishers, or enrichers.
- Capabilities are discoverable so custom interfaces can adapt dynamically.
- Build custom extensions without touching the core.
