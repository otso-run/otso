The Otso iOS interface focuses on one-thumb publishing. It stores drafts locally, syncs in the background, and supports the full Micropub post kinds.

- IndieAuth login with multi-account support.
- Compose notes, articles, photos, replies, reposts, likes, bookmarks, check-ins, and RSVPs.
- Local-first engine with SQLite drafts and an outbox queue for retryable sync.
- Built with Swift and modern SwiftUI patterns.

## Share Sheet extension

A Share Sheet extension lets any app hand content to Otso. From Safari, Photos, or a reader, choose Otso to queue a draft instantly.

- Accepts text, URLs, images, or files.
- Prompts for post kind before queuing the item.
- Works with Shortcuts and App Intents for quick capture flows.
