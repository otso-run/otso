description: Event categories, fields, and before/after policy.

Events capture every action Otso takes.

## Categories

- **import** – data pulled from a source.
- **publish** – sent to external services.
- **enrich** – tags, alt-text, or other processing.

## Schema

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "kind": "note",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "content": {},
  "visibility": "public",
  "before": {},
  "after": {}
}
```

`before` and `after` allow reversible operations like updates.

## Guidelines

- Use `before`/`after` only when an action changes data.
- Keep `content` small; large blobs should live in media tables.
- Prefer new events over mutation when possible.
